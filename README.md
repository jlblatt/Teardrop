# Teardrop

### Audio Visualizer

Teardrop is the spiritual successor to [Raindrop](https://github.com/jlblatt/Raindrop):

> Ever since I got into coding, I was fascinated by music visualization programs such as [Cthugha](http://www.afn.org/~cthugha/), [G-Force](https://www.soundspectrum.com/g-force/), and [MilkDrop](http://www.geisswerks.com/milkdrop/).  This project is at best a small homage to those programs (and the many more that have come and gone since).

Working with MIDI files proved unworkable for several reasons, so Teardrop is a similar concept using the Web Audio API and a more traditional method of visualizing an audio signal.  Teardrop implements time & frequency domain analyses, as well as beat detection, and uses WebGL to render 3D graphics insides of the browser.
